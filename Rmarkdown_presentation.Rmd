# Create a vector called 'events' with 10 random numbers in it.
library(dplyr)
library(NHSRdatasets)
data("LOS_model")

set.seed(123)

events<- c(10,3,6,2,5,7,9,3,5,6)

# Create a second vector called 'predictor' with:

predictor<- events * runif(10,min = 2, 4)


# Use the `plot` function to visualise the points

plot(events, predictor)

# ggplot2 version, ggplot takes a data.frame:
library(ggplot2)


# Create a data frame called 'my_data' from both 'events' and 'predictor'

my_data <- data.frame(events, predictor)


# What is the next statement doing?  
group<- factor(rep_len(c("A","B","C"), 10))


# How would you add this as a column to your data frame?

my_data$group<-group

# Rmarkdown: 
### Documentation, Notebooks, and Reporting Structures in `R`


---

# Overview

`Markdown` (.md) is a common free-text format.  It can be used to write documents then mark the various different sections, formats etc.

--

<br>

`Rmarkdown` is an `R`-specific flavour that adds `R` code into the `Mardown` paradigm.  You can write a document that runs code, chose whether to show this code at the output, and then render it to various output formats.


--

+ Can `knit` to HTML, PDF, Word or find other connectors, from a single `Rmarkdown` file using `knitr` package.

--

+ Allows you to collaborate and share your code in well formatted reports, or notebooks.

--

+ It could also be used as a final report, teaching material, blog post etc.


+ Can be parameterised to provide standard/regular reports control by parameters like date, or specialty code.

<br>

This is section is primarily taken from __R Markdown: The Definitive Guide__ by _Yihui Xie, J. J. Allaire, Garrett Grolemund_

# Structure

Markdown documents are composed of three main elements:

+ Metadata
+ Text
+ Code

--

<br>
Other elements, depending on the output, might be:
+ CSS files
+ javascript
+ html 'widgets'
+ Shiny apps

---

# Metadata: YAML

The metadata of a markdown file is the first thing you see at the top of the document.  

+ It sets properties like document name, author but also functional elements like:
  + File locations
  + Output formats (HTML, PDF, Word etc.)
  + Styling elements, including CSS
--
<br><br>
+ It is written in __YAML__ - ('YAML Ain't Markup Language') [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)
  - Reference: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/yaml-options.html
  
```yaml

  html_doucment
  word_document

# Text

Free-text is treated as such, and coded as a paragraph `<p>` element in HTML.  Other formatting is achieved using special characters, pandoc, HTML etc.

# Code (1)

In-line code uses single backticks e.g. `` `r "\u0060r mean(rnorm(50,50,12))\u0060"` ``  evalautes to `r mean(rnorm(50,50,12))` (figure is generated from `R` code here)

<br>
Similarly you can start code blocks with three backticks:  ` ``` ` , e.g. 

--

```{r plotexample, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=5,fig.height=4.3}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=mpg))+
  geom_histogram(col=1,fill="orange", alpha=0.75,bins=10)+
  ggtitle("Miles per gallon (mpg) of cars in 'mtcars' dataset")

```


---

# Code(2)

The header of the last section was:

<img src= 'Assets/Code_Header.png' width=100%>

<br><br>
So we gave it the language (r), a name for the chunk ('plotexample'), 
turned warnings and messages off, and set 
options for alignment and size.

--

<br><br>
There are a lot of options for code chunks, but here are the main important ones:
+ eval=FALSE -  __Don't evaluate/run the code block__
+ echo=FALSE -  __Don't display the code block__
+ include=FALSE -  __Run the code but don't include in final document__
+ collapse = TRUE -  __Merge the code and all outputs into a single chunk for display__

---

# Parameters:

Here's where it gets even more useful.  If you have a report that you need to repeat many times, you might want to use 'parameters.'

+ You may want to:
 + Run daily reports for different wards / gp practises
 + Change the key measure of a standard report
 + Change report dates etc.

--

You add parameters to your YAML header:

```{r yaml2, eval=FALSE}
---
title: "An introduction Rmarkdown"
author: "Chris Mainey"
date: "16/05/2019"
output: 
  html_doucment
{{params:}}
{{  Trust: "Trust1"}}
---
```
--

+ ...then refer to them as if in a `data.frame`: `params$Trust`
--

+ You can call `rmarkdown::render()` with `params` or `params="ask"` 



---

# Fancier Stuff

There are lots of fancier thing you can do, some of which require plugins, HTML or CSS but many don't.

.pull-left[
+ MathJax
+ LaTeX
+ Footnotes and annotations
+ BibTeX Bibliographies (including integration with zotero etc.)
+ `htmlWidgets` like interactive maps, paginated tables with filters
+ Shiny documents
+ Powerpoint and Word templates

# Exercise 9: 
## Build an `Rmarkdown` document from template

+ Use the `File` menu to create a new Markdown document
+ Read through it and see the formatting
+ 'knit' the document together, using the `knitr` package, button at the top
+ Look at the output


---

# Exercise 10: 
### Build a parametrised `Rmarkdown` using `LOS_models`

+ Create a new markdown document or clear your last one.
+ In this document, please do the following:
 + Create a hidden code block that loads the data
 + Add some titles and text to explain what is happening
 + Add a hyper-link to the `NHSRdataset` package (find it via Google)
 + Add a code block using `dplyr` to summarise the `mean` and `median` LOS
 + Add a horizontal rule 
 + Do the same again for just `Trust1`
 + Can you use a parameter to set the Trust?

---
# Rmarkdown tips

+ Check the 'options' via the tools menu and check you are using `knitr` not `sweave`
+ You can `knit` to PDF or Word easily, but may need to install additional packages
+ You may need Latex installed on Windows, I use Miktex or `tinytex`
+ You can control lots of stuff using the YAML or chunk options
+ You can use CCS to style outputs consistently
+ You can write presentations, e.g. this is using `rmakrdown` with `xaringan`
+ Other extension include `blogdown`, `bookdown`, `thesisdown` and many others
+ You can use with reference managers, e.g. Endnote or Zotero, using BibTeX
