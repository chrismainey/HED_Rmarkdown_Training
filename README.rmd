## Introduction

This GitHub repository contains the presentations, `R` script exercises and solutions, as well as datasets for the HED `R` markdown course.  

The repository is structured in folders, with:

+ Answers - containing answers to the exercises
+ Assets - containing images and other formatting parts for presentations
+ Exercises - containing shell scripts and instructions for exercises
 + A sub-folder called __Solutions__ provides answered scripts
+ Presentations are in the top level of the repository, built using the `xaringan` package for presentations written in RMarkdown, HTML slides and PDF versions.



This repository relies on several other `R` packages, including:

+ `tidyverse` (a wrapper for many packages, specifically `ggplot2`, `dplyr` & `tidyr`)
+ `xaringan`
+ `Rmarkdown`
+ `NHSRdatasets`
