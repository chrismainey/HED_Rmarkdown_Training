HED R Markdown Training
================

## Introduction

This GitHub repository contains the presentations, `R` script exercises
and solutions, as well as datasets for the HED `R` markdown course.

The repository is structured in folders, with:

  - Answers - containing answers to the exercises
  - Assets - containing images and other formatting parts for
    presentations
  - Exercises - containing shell scripts and instructions for exercises
  - A sub-folder called **Solutions** provides answered scripts
  - Presentations are in the top level of the repository, built using
    the `xaringan` package for presentations written in RMarkdown, HTML
    slides and PDF versions.

This repository relies on several other `R` packages, including:

  - `tidyverse` (a wrapper for many packages, specifically `ggplot2`,
    `dplyr` & `tidyr`)
  - `xaringan`
  - `Rmarkdown`
  - `NHSRdatasets`
